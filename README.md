# C-Code Vault

Welcome to my **C-Code Vault**! This repository serves as a collection of my C programming journey, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts. I will be documenting my progress, along with day-wise breakdowns and practice projects that I complete along the way.

## 🚀 Objective
The goal of this repository is to showcase my learning and progress in C programming. I will build a strong foundation in C, which will later assist me in learning more advanced topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ and other areas of software development.

## 🗓️ Learning Timeline
This journey will be broken down into **day-wise learning** with corresponding practice exercises. The main areas I will be covering include:
- Core C programming concepts.
- Data types, variables, functions, and operators.
- Control statements, loops, arrays, and pointers.
- Advanced topics like memory management, file handling, and structures.
- Mini-projects that solidify my understanding of C.

## 🏆 Projects & Milestones
- **Day 1:** Basics of C Programming (variables, data types, and I/O).
- **Day 2:** Control Statements (if-else, switch-case, logical operators).
- **Upcoming Days:** 
  - Loops (for, while, do-while).
  - Arrays and Strings.
  - Functions and Recursion.
  - Pointers and Memory Management.
  - File Handling.
  - Implementing projects (e.g., basic calculator, student record system).

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
- **IDE:** Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code, or any preferred IDE.
- **Compiler:** GCC or MinGW for compiling C programs.
- **Version Control:** Git for tracking my progress.
- **GitHub Pages:** A live version of some projects (future plans).

## 🔄 How to Contribute
- Feel free to fork the repository and contribute improvements, bug fixes, or enhancements to any of the projects I work on.
- If you have any suggestions or ideas, open an issue or pull request.

## 📈 Progress Tracker
To track the progress of my learning, I will create day-wise markdown files for each day of my journey. These files will contain:
- A summary of the topics I learned.
- The practice programs or challenges completed.
- Any challenges or notes I encountered.

You can explore these day-wise files by navigating to the corresponding day folders in this repository.

## 🔮 Future Goals
- Master C++ programming for advanced DSA concepts.
- Implement complex algorithms and data structures in C.
- Contribute to open-source C projects.
