# C-Code Vault

Welcome to my **C-Code Vault**! This repository serves as a collection of my C programming journey, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts. I will be documenting my progress, along with day-wise breakdowns and practice projects that I complete along the way.

## üöÄ Objective
The goal of this repository is to showcase my learning and progress in C programming. I will build a strong foundation in C, which will later assist me in learning more advanced topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++ and other areas of software development.

## üóìÔ∏è Learning Timeline
### Day 1: Introduction to C
- **Topics Covered:** Basics of C programming, first C program, compilation process, variables, data types, and input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`).
- **Practice:** Writing programs for basic operations (e.g., "Hello, World!", swapping numbers, and simple arithmetic).

### Day 2: Control Statements
- **Topics Covered:** Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch-case`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- **Practice:** Programs for decision-making tasks (e.g., largest and smallest of 3 numbers, grade calculator, leap year checker, and quadratic equation solver).

### Day 3: Loops
- **Topics Covered:** Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), nested loops, and flow control using `break` and `continue`.
- **Practice:** Writing programs for repetitive tasks (e.g., multiplication tables, Fibonacci sequence, printing patterns, factorial calculator, prime number check, and GCD/LCM calculator).
- Here are the updated sections with Day 5 removed:

### Day 4: Arrays 
- **Topics Covered:** Introduction to arrays, 1D arrays (declaration, initialization, traversal), and basic operations.  
- **Practice:** Finding the sum and average of an array, reversing an array without using a second array, and implementing binary search in an array.

## üèÜ Projects & Milestones

- **GitHub Pages:** A live version of some projects (future plans).

## üîÑ How to Contribute
## How to Contribute
- Feel free to fork this repository and contribute improvements, bug fixes, or enhancements to any of the projects I work on.
- If you have suggestions or ideas, open an issue or pull request!

## üìà Progress Tracker
To track the progress of my learning, I will create day-wise markdown files for each day of my journey. These files will contain:
- A summary of the topics I learned.
- The practice programs or challenges completed.
- Any challenges or notes I encountered.

You can explore these day-wise files by navigating to the corresponding day folders in this repository.

## üîÆ Future Goals
## Future Goals
- Master C++ programming for advanced DSA concepts.
- Implement complex algorithms and data structures in C.
- Contribute to open-source C projects.
