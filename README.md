# C-Code Vault

Welcome to my **C-Code Vault**! This repository serves as a collection of my C programming journey, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts. I will be documenting my progress, along with day-wise breakdowns and practice projects that I complete along the way.

## üìö What You'll Find Here

- **Day-wise Learning**: Each day is dedicated to a specific topic, starting from the very basics to advanced concepts.
- **Code Samples**: Includes code examples to practice and understand concepts like variables, loops, functions, arrays, structures, unions, memory management, and more.
- **Practice Exercises**: I have solved problems and challenges to strengthen my understanding.
- **Projects**: Small C projects and exercises to demonstrate the application of the learned concepts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

- Day 1: Introduction to C
- Day 2: Control Statements
- Day 3: Loops
- Day 4: Arrays
- Day 5: Strings & Functions
- Day 6: Functions
- Day 7: Pointers
- Day 8: Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Day 9: **Practice** (Review and reinforce previous topics)
- Day 10: Structures
- Day 11: Unions
- And more...

- If you have suggestions or ideas, open an issue or pull request!

## üìà Progress Tracker
To track the progress of my learning, I will create day-wise markdown files for each day of my journey. These files will contain:
- A summary of the topics I learned.
- The practice programs or challenges completed.
- Any challenges or notes I encountered.

You can explore these day-wise files by navigating to the corresponding day folders in this repository.

## üîÆ Future Goals
## Future Goals
- Master C++ programming for advanced DSA concepts.
- Implement complex algorithms and data structures in C.
- Contribute to open-source C projects.
